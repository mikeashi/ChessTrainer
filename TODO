- As a user I can start the app with a given position or with the starting position. (DONE)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a user I want to be able to go back a node so that I can add a new variation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a user I want to be able to get the next move or moves.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a user I can ask the app to play a move
  or I can play a move to be evaluated by the app using the given opening db if the move
  made by the user is not in the db, the app should ask the user if he wants to add the move to the
  current line in the db.

We have to rebuild the tree and tree node:
    each node has a board , hash, move, children, parent.

    - when making a new move :
        we check the current node's children if the move is already played we change the current node to the found node.
        if not we create a new node and add it to the current children and set current to the newly created node.

    - we can go back to the parent node or we can get the next moves array be checking the current node's children moves.

    - when searching for a move we can scan the tree and look for the current board hash:
           - if we find no nodes then we dont have a move.
           - if we find one or more we take their moves and add them to the array.
